# Task 3 📊 SQL for Data Analysis – Sample Orders Dataset
## 📁 Dataset Overview
- Name	sample_orders_dataset
- Source	Public e-commerce dataset (sourced online)
- Database Tool	MySQL
- File Included	sample_orders_dataset.sql

## 🎯 Objective
To demonstrate SQL-based data extraction, transformation, and analysis using a structured e-commerce dataset.
Focus areas include:

- Data manipulation

- Joins and subqueries

- Aggregate functions

- Views

- Query performance optimization

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Tool / Technology	Purpose
- MySQL	Database platform
- MySQL Workbench	Execute and visualize SQL queries
- SQL	Query language used
- Markdown	For documenting the project in README

## 🧩 SQL Concepts & Tasks Performed
Task Category	Description
1. Basic Queries	Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY for data filtering & sorting
2. Aggregation	Used COUNT(), SUM(), AVG() to compute business metrics
3. Joins	Implemented INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT joins for cross-table analysis
4. Subqueries	Applied subqueries for intermediate or nested logic
5. Views	Created reusable views for repeated analysis
6. Indexing	Indexed key columns to enhance query performance

## 📸 Screenshots
📂 Attached with submission: screenshots showing output of each SQL query executed in MySQL Workbench.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes
- Proficient in querying and manipulating structured data

- Gained insights using joins and aggregation techniques
